# EntDB Logo Spec (Final v1)

## Direction
- Theme: ancient-tree energy with modern database clarity
- Metaphor: tree silhouette emerging from a DB vessel
- Style: minimal vector, no character art, no franchise iconography

## Primary Assets
- `entdb-mark-final.svg`: mark only (app icon, favicon source)
- `entdb-lockup-final.svg`: mark + wordmark (docs/site headers)

## Color Tokens
- `--entdb-forest-700`: `#1F4D3A` (primary strokes/text)
- `--entdb-forest-500`: `#4A6A5B` (secondary text)
- `--entdb-surface-050`: `#F4F7F2` (light background)

## Geometry Rules
- Stroke weight: 8-9 units at 256px canvas equivalent
- Tree trunk centered to container midpoint
- DB vessel sits at base and anchors the mark
- Rounded line joins/caps for organic but precise shape

## Usage
- Mark-only minimum display: 24px
- Lockup minimum width: 180px
- Keep clearspace >= trunk width on all sides
- Prefer single-color application where possible

## Avoid
- IP-specific LOTR character art or symbols
- Over-detailed bark texture
- Gradients or shadows in primary logo
- Renaming technical concepts to force theme
